timesheet-accounting
====================

Just some useful scripts for keeping track of time; mainly used when I was a 260 TA in junior year.

`run' analyzes the JSON files you generate when you run 'update' and tells you how many hours you've worked in a given month,
and how much you'd expect to be paid given a base hourly rate and tax rate.
